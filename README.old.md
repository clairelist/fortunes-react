# fortunes-react
Welcome to the fortunes-react app! I made a similar app for a personal blog months ago, before learning React; consider this the react refactoring of that app! 

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
react-scripts version 5 released a breaking change which is currently messing with making changes on a test server (ie by running npm start). Be aware when trying to edit this app while you have a server running!
Currently this can be partially circumvented by restarting your dev server.
